	<h2>Astrophysics 🌌</h2>
		<p>After a scientific Baccaulauréat, I am still very interested in science. I read on a daily basis the <a href="https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/" target="_blank">science & avenir magazine</a>. I am also interested in medicine, general discoveries and for sure astrophysics, I read a lot of books from famous authors such as Huber Reeves or André Brahic and Stephen Hawking. </p>
</div>
	
<div>
	<h2>Travelling 🌎</h2>
		<p>Thanks to my parents, I visited countries in almost every continent. I am passionated about it because the <strong> diversity</strong> allows us to discover but it also gathers us through our differences. You will find below a few places where I went. 
		Coming from <strong>Tahiti</strong> , I love discovering and sharing culture. Find more about Tahiti below. </p>

<div>
	<h2>Cooking 🍜</h2>
		<p>Cooking is also a big part of the <strong>culture</strong>  of a country. It is passing from generation to generation. You can share it, learn it, teach it and obviously eat it. You can discover a country by tasting its food and I find it amazing. </p>
</div>
	
<div>
	<h2>Sport 🥇</h2>
		<p>Hapiness is about balance isn't it? Sport is the best way to <strong>feel good mentally </strong> and physically. Team-games build teamspirit, it helps us thinking and working in team. When you do sports alone, it allows you to focus on yourself and improve.</p>
